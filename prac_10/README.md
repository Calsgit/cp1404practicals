# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates weren't particularly accurate, being lower than the actual time elapsed.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

The accuracy did not appear to improve.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I have learned that I take way longer than I think to write code.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Docstrings always have periods at the end.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Some people do not commit as much.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[perryvillacampa's Prac 06 feedback](https://github.com/perryvillacampa/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-20825273036)

### Explanation

I pointed out a few areas where they could consider improving the code in the future, like using datetime or removing a
large chunk of commented-out redundant code.

### Good Code Review 2

[nhptvn's Prac 09 feedback](https://github.com/nhptvn/cp1404practicals/pull/5#event-21153669701)

### Explanation

I found multiple places that could potentially be refactored into a separate function, amongst other small improvements
and pointing a different design choice out. I also recommended they commit more often, especially after adding files,
since they added and finished files in a single commit.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would not change anything; I can't think of anything to change.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Committing frequently.
